# Performance Test Report Analysis - June 23, 2025

## Summary
- **Test Period**: 12:30:55 AM - 12:50:39 AM (approximately 20 minutes)
- **Target Host**: http://localhost:8000
- **Script**: locustfile.py
- **Total Requests**: 7,187
- **Overall Success Rate**: 96.4% (257 failures)
- **Average Throughput**: 6.1 requests/second

## Per-Endpoint Analysis

### Car Listings Endpoint (High Load)
- **Requests**: 5,285
- **Success Rate**: 95.1% (257 failures)
- **Response Times**:
  - Median: 160ms
  - 90%: 720ms
  - 95%: 990ms
  - 99%: 1,200ms
- **Performance Assessment**: GOOD - Maintained reasonable response times under high load with acceptable failure rate.

### Marketplace Endpoint (High Load)
- **Requests**: 1,842
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Response Times**:
  - Median: 290ms
  - 90%: 390ms
  - 95%: 410ms
  - 99%: 510ms
- **Performance Assessment**: EXCELLENT - Consistent performance with no failures.

### Login Endpoints
- **Requests**: 60 total (across different test types)
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Response Times**:
  - Median: 14,000ms
  - 95%: 17,000ms
- **Performance Assessment**: POOR - Authentication is extremely slow, taking 12-17 seconds.

## Areas of Concern

1. **Login Performance**:
   - The login process takes 12-17 seconds, which is unacceptably slow
   - This could severely impact user experience and frustrate users
   - Root cause should be investigated immediately

2. **Car Listings Occasional Spikes**:
   - While median performance is good (160ms), the max response time reached 12.6 seconds
   - Suggests occasional resource contention or database query problems

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action Items**:
   - Optimize the authentication system - investigate why login takes 12+ seconds
   - Add caching for frequently accessed listing data
   - Monitor database query performance during peak loads

2. **Medium-term Improvements**:
   - Implement connection pooling if not already in place
   - Consider adding a read replica for the database to handle listing queries
   - Review indexes on car listing tables

3. **Monitoring Improvements**:
   - Set up continuous performance monitoring
   - Create alerts for response times exceeding 1 second
   - Implement distributed tracing to identify bottlenecks

## Pass/Fail Assessment

Based on common web application performance standards:

| Test Case | Criteria | Result | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| TC_PERF_002 | 95% responses < 1s | 95% = 980ms | PASS |
| TC_PERF_002 | Error rate < 5% | 3.6% | PASS |
| TC_PERF_002 | No server crashes | None observed | PASS |
