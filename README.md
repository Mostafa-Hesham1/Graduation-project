## 📌 Overview

Vehicle Souq addresses critical challenges in Egypt's used car market, where inflation and inconsistent pricing practices make it difficult for buyers and sellers to determine fair vehicle values. Our AI-powered system combines advanced image recognition with precise price prediction to bring transparency and reliability to the market.

This project is based on extensive research conducted by Mostafa Hisham, Hisham Ahmed, and Dr. Mohamed Labib from MSA University, Egypt. Our methodology combines computer vision with machine learning to deliver accurate car identification and pricing, even for users with limited automotive knowledge.

## 🔍 The Problem

Egypt's used car market faces several challenges:
